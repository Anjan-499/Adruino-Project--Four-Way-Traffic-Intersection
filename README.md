# Adruino Project: Four-Way Traffic Intersection

  The simulation of Four-Way Traffic Intersection model is successfully tested.
A model of Four-Way Traffic intersection is built up that has a main road, an auxiliary road and a pedestrian pathway. Main road is given priority so that it stays green unless the pedestrian switch button is pushed.
